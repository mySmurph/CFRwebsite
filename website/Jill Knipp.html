		<p>Over the past 25 years I have worked with many hundreds of diverse clients, ranging from 14 to 85 years old, who have entrusted their health and fitness to me. It is my life’s passion to assist other people in reaching their very best physical condition so they can truly enjoy life at any age. My 94-year-old mother always said, “As long as you have good health, everything else is secondary.” These are wise words to live by.</p>

		<p>Like many of us, addiction has touched Jill's family as well as her heart. As a result she has a special passion for working with those in active recovery to rebuild their physical and mental health through specialized and focused fitness. </p>
