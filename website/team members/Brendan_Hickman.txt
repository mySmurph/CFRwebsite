<h3>Brendan Hickman</h3>

		Most recently Mr. Hickman served as Chief Commercial Officer for  UBM Aviation, part of a 1.5 billion London-based firm, where he was responsible for marketing, advertising, sales, and legal. In addition, he was the General Manager of their North American operation. His focus for the following 18 months was to address their critical challenges in the global marketplace. Prior to that Mr. Hickman spent 15 years with a Fortune 500 technology firm as VP of the Transportation and Logistics Consulting Practice.  Mr. Hickman has extensive marketing, sales, and general management background. </p>
<p>“Marketing and general management are my two primary areas of both experience and success over my long career. As an independent consultant for much of my early career and after retirement, I have focused on establishing strategic direction for small to medium size companies with an emphasis on developing and documenting business strategy and /or marketing plans.</p> 
<p>“After two retirements from two senior executive positions, my passion is now to see Changing the Face of Recovery and its mission become successful, not only in their current markets of Chicago and San Diego, but across the Nation.”  </p>
<p>“Changing the Face of Recovery was brought to my attention by friends fighting personal, familial and societal destruction caused by this devastating disease called addiction. There are few families today that have not been touched in some manner by this disease. Mine is no exception. Therefore my role in CFR as an experienced, retired business executive is amplified by also having experience and empathy for the community we strive to serve.”
