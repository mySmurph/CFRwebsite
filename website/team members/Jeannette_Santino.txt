<p>Since 1994 Jeannette has utilized a unique form of perception retraining techniques, with her clients, as well as herself for her own personal growth. “Having gone through traditional counseling for my own trauma, I went in search of other techniques that I hoped would prove to be more effective. Many specialty classes later, I finally honed in on the combination of techniques that I used most often and found to be the most powerful, most effective to create permanent change in the shortest amount of time. Because I have my own style as a Trauma Release Coach  I have copy protected these techniques as the Insightful Change Method. By utilizing this method, healthy change can become permanent."</p>
