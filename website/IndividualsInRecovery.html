		* Based on information from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Soberplace, and Foundations Recovery Network, the following statistics give a current picture of recovery:
		<ul>
			<li>47% of addicts relapse in 1st year after treatment</li>
     			<li>61% of those who relapse will do so more than once</li>
		</ul>
		<p>*  Factors likely to contribute to relapse: mental health state, family history of addiction, the type of substance used, stress level, and a failure to seek quality aftercare</p>
		
		<p>*  ​According to Return to Work Knowledge Base, rehabilitation is most successful when it addresses a person's self-efficacy; One's belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task through:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Previous experience
			<li>Observations of others' achievements
			<li>Verbal encouragement
			<li>Emotional state
		</ul>
		<p>*  Low self-efficacy can result in a lack of motivation, uncertainty of abilities, fear of failure, missed appointments, and the desire to drop out altogether. Those who lack confidence in their coping ability are often more anxious and distressed.   Fear and anxiety cause worry about returning to work. Return to work outcomes can be improved when rehabilitation is aimed at increasing self-efficacy.</p>

		<p>*  "Forty percent of those who managed only two years of abstinence eventually went back to the bottle. After five years of sobriety, however, relapse was rare."  Five Years is Magic Number for Recovering Alcoholics; W.J. Cromie, The Harvard University Gazette, 1996;</p>
