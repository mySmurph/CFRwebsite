		<h3><center>~ Important Reminder ~</center></h3>

	<p>"Recovery involves individual, family, and community strength and responsibility. Individuals, families, and communities have strengths and resources that serve as a foundation for recovery...Individuals should be supported in speaking for themselves. ​Communities have responsibilities to provide opportunities and resources to address discrimination and to foster social inclusion and recovery."
	<span class= "atribute"> - SAMHSA</span>
	</p>

	<p>"Recovery is based on respect. Community systems, societal acceptance, and appreciation for people affected by mental health and substance use problems - including protecting their rights and eliminating discrimination - are crucial in achieving recovery. There is a need to acknowledge that taking steps towards recovery may require great courage. Self-acceptance, developing a positive and meaningful sense of identity, and regaining belief in one's self are particularly important."<span class= "atribute"> - SAMHSA</span>
