		<p class = "line">"<b>Recovery occurs via many pathways.</b> Individuals have unique needs, strengths, preferences, goals, culture, backgrounds, and trauma experience that determine their pathways to recovery.
Recovery pathways are highly personalized. Recovery is built on the multiple capacities, strengths, talents, coping abilities, resources, and inherent values of each individual.<br />
<b>Recovery is Holistic.</b> Recovery encompasses an individual's whole life, including mind, body, spirit, and community.
<br />
<b>Recovery is supported through relationship and social networks.</b> An important factor in the recovery process is the presence and involvement of people who believe in the person's ability to recover. Those who offer hope, support, and encouragement and who also suggest strategies and resources for change. Through these relationships, people leave unhealthy and unfulfilling life roles behind and engage in new roles, e.g., partner, caregiver, friend, student, employee.<b>This leads to a greater sense of belonging, personhood, empowerment, autonomy, social inclusion and community participation.</b>" </span>
