			<p>Changing the Face of Recovery's ReEmployment program is a game changer in the field of post recovery support programs. Statistics show that the stress of maintaining employment or the lack of employment can cause severe depression and despair. These conditions frequently contribute to relapses, reinforced low self-worth, and eventual withdrawal from families and communities.​</p>

			<p>​The ReEmployment division for Individuals in Active Recovery will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Form an alliance with our corporate clients and other community business partners to support the recovery process.   </li>
				<li>Provide rehabilitated IAR program graduates to our business partners for employment.   </li>
				<li>Work along with the employer, managers, and supervisors to address potential problem areas that may arise with the employee. The IAR graduates will be monitored and counseled throughout the process until they have achieved stability that satisfies all participants. We will continue this process for up to two years if needed.</li>
				<li>Our combined goal is to prevent relapse during the most critical time of the individual's recovery. By working as a team within the community, we can reduce or eliminate the need for termination of the individual in recovery thereby reducing a major cause of potential relapse. This division of our program is a win/win/win for the individual, the employer, and the community.  </li>
